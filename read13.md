## Write the following steps in the correct order:
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Receive authorization code
Receive access token
Make a request to the access token endpoint

## What can you do with an authorization code?
- we can exchange it with the access token.

## What can you do with an access token?
- we can use it to get the user info.

## Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
- no need to store more data in the database and make the process of login or sign up faster and easier.

* **client ID** is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients

* A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors

* An authorization endpoint is an HTTP endpoint that micropub and IndieAuth clients can use to identify a user or obtain an authorization code (which is then later exchanged for an access token) to be able to post to their website.

* The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors


* The authorization code is a number that confirms your debit or credit card transaction is approved. For this reason, it

* Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.
