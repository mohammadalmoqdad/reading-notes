## Why would a developer choose to make data models?

  - Ensures that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented. Omission of data will lead to creation of faulty reports and produce incorrect results.
A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels.
Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures.
It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical database.
It is also helpful to identify missing and redundant data.
Though the initial creation of data model is labor and time consuming, in the long run, it makes your IT infrastructure upgrade and maintenance cheaper and faster.

# Terms:

* **database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.



 * **date model**  is a model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities



* **database schema** of a database is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS)




 * **Query Language (SQL)** is the standard and most widely used programming language for relational databases.





 * **Document** is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.





 * **DOM** is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.




 * **document**stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.
