## Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
- A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.

## Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
- we can create an instance of the collection class and import that instance into the files that will use it.
- it is used when we should only one instance of the class like logging and drive.. etc

## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- I will use express to build the server, cors to give needed files to acces it, dotenv for usin .env file , then i will use express.Router() to create  the midllewares by building them with params because of thd routes verbs.

* **Middleware** functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

* **Dynamic Module Loading** is importing files but not in an instance way that would help to import file not always but when needed.
 - Dynamic load modules provide the following functions:
 1.  Load, refresh, and delete installation load modules, which are not part of the IBM® base JES2 code, after JES2 initialization processing. The dynamic table pairs and exit routine addresses are updated as needed. The load modules provide load and delete routines to perform any processing that might be needed to adjust data pointers JES2 does not process.
 2. Alter the list of routines associated with an exit point through operator command.

 * **Singleton Pattern** limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.

* **CRUD -> REST Method Matches** GET and POST can be used to tunnel information to remote services through URIs and how POST can be used to transfer XML documents between services.

* **Mock Testing** (chiefly Britain) An examination, where the marks may or may not count, which serves chiefly as practice for future exams or so that the teachers are able to set a grade before the end of term.
