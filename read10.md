To link routes with DB's :

1. we first create out schema and connect it to database

2. we create a collection to avoid repeating the usage of the schema .

3. we create our server using express.

4. we write out routes and link them with the four verbs (they should be linked to the collection CRUD methods):

  - GET, PUT, POST, DELTE.

5. we run out server and use applications like postman to send data inside the body.
