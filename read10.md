# Stack:
 * Def: A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* we can perform 4 operations on a stack :
1. push(value): 
   - to add a value to the top of the stack.
2. pop(): 
  - to return the top element at the stack and remove it from it.
3. peek(): 
  - to return the top element at the stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty():
  - return true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

* stack follow two conceots : 
1. LIFO : last element in is the first element out.
2. FILO : first element in is the last element out.

# Queue:
* Def: A queue is data structure that consisits of severla node we are addding the new element to the end of it and when want to elelment to it we have to start from the begaining.

* Temmnology of Queues: 
1. **Enqueue** - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. **Dequeue** - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. **Front** - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. **Rear** - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

* Queues follow these concepts :
1. FIFO : which means that the frirst element enter the queue is the first element leave it.
2. LILO : last element enter the queue is the last element leave it.
