## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?
-  It allows us to write more efficient code, speed up the development process, and automatically apply the best-recommended practices. It was mainly created to solve the THREE MAJOR ISSUES with Redux:

* *redux toolkit slices*: Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
Have to add a lot of packages to build a large scale application
Redux requires too much boilerplate code which makes it cumbersome to write efficient and clean code.

* *Namespace* component is another feature request that is available in React JSX. ... By using the standard JavaScript syntax approach, which is object property access, this feature is useful for assigning components directly as <Namespace.




## React Native
- *React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks*
- *there is no difference in handling the state between React and React Native.*

- Expo handles the gritty parts of building for each app store so you don't need Xcode or Android Studio to get your app into people's hands.
