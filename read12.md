## Why is authentication important?
- Authentication is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access its protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.


## Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?
- Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software.

## hat is the difference between hashing and encryption?
- Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. Hashing, however, is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest. With a properly designed algorithm, there is no way to reverse the hashing process to reveal the original password

## What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
- Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used. Encryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires the use of a key (kept secret) in order to return to plaintext.

## What is a token used for?
- A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created.

*  **Authentication** is the process of recognizing a user's identity. It is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials. ... The credential often takes the form of a password, which is a secret and known only to the individual and the system.


* **Authorization** is a security mechanism used to determine user/client privileges or access levels related to system resources, including computer programs, files, services, data and application features. Authorization is normally preceded by authentication for user identity verification.


*  **encryption** translates data into another form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key (formally called a decryption key) or password can read it. Encrypted data is commonly referred to as ciphertext, while unencrypted data is called plaintext.

* **Hashing** is designed to solve the problem of needing to efficiently find or store an item in a collection

* **session** variables store temporary information, sometimes to use for retrieving and viewing data on multiple web pages.

* **Cookies** are data, stored in small text files, on your computer. When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user. ... When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.

* **token** is an object that represents something else, such as another object (either physical or virtual), or an abstract concept 

* **Basic authentication**, the username and password must be encoded with base64. To receive authorization, the client sends the userid and password, separated by a single colon (":") character, within a base64 encoded string in the credentials.

* **Encoding** is the process of putting a sequence of characters such as letters, numbers and other special characters into a specialized format for efficient transmission.


* **secret key** is the piece of information or parameter that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages in a symmetric

* **Cryptography** is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa
